Amazon is drawing criticism for its plan to acquire Roomba maker iRobot for $1.7 billion in an effort to expand its footprint in the home devices and consumer robotics markets. Ron Knox, a senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self Reliance, has called on regulators to challenge the deal, calling it the \"most dangerous, threatening\" acquisition in the e-commerce behemoth's history. In a lengthy Twitter thread on Aug. 5, Knox argued that the deal would take Amazon's biggest rival out of the market and allow it to beat the remaining competition through predatory pricing. \"Jeff Bezos has said that Amazon wants to buy its way to dominance. By snatching up Roomba and pairing it with its vast monopoly power fueled by its Prime system, it would do just that,\" he said. \"There may be other smart vacuums today, but there won't be once Amazon owns Roomba.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_20 Document Index":"3","Noise_20 Document":"A slew of home-cleaning robots adds to the company's tech arsenal, making it more involved in consumer's lives beyond static things like voice control.
