It has been a while since the profilers' last on-screen case, but the characters' stories continued during that period. Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn\u2019t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series. Having its official title of Criminal Minds: Evolution quickly establishes that the show is part of the Criminal Minds brand, which could entice some formers fans to check it out, especially those who haven\u2019t been keeping track of Paramount+\u2019s efforts to bring back the BAU on the small screen.

Amazon is drawing criticism for its plan to acquire Roomba maker iRobot for $1.7 billion in an effort to expand its footprint in the home devices and consumer robotics markets. Ron Knox, a senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self Reliance, has called on regulators to challenge the deal, calling it the \"most dangerous, threatening\" acquisition in the e-commerce behemoth's history. In a lengthy Twitter thread on Aug. 5, Knox argued that the deal would take Amazon's biggest rival out of the market and allow it to beat the remaining competition through predatory pricing. \"Jeff Bezos has said that Amazon wants to buy its way to dominance. By snatching up Roomba and pairing it with its vast monopoly power fueled by its Prime system, it would do just that,\" he said. \"There may be other smart vacuums today, but there won't be once Amazon owns Roomba.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"A slew of home-cleaning robots adds to the company's tech arsenal, making it more involved in consumer's lives beyond static things like voice control. Amazon's Astro robot, which helps with tasks like setting an alarm, was unveiled last year at an introductory price of $1,000. But its rollout has been limited and has received a lackluster response. The company hasn't had much success with household robots, but the iRobot acquisition and the company's strong market reputation provide a \"massive foothold in the consumer robot market\" that could help Amazon replicate the success of its Echo line of smart speakers, said Lian Jye Su, a robotics industry analyst for ABI Research. Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a \"race-to-the-bottom\" competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum. On Friday, iRobot reported its quarterly results. Revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions and delays, and the company announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce. Amazon said it will acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction that will include iRobot's net debt. The company has total current debt of approximately $332.1 million as of July 2.
