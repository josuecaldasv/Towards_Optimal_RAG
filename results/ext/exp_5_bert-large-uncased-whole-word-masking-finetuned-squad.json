Amazon's Astro robot, which helps with tasks like setting an alarm, was unveiled last year at an introductory price of $1,000. But its rollout has been limited and has received a lackluster response. The company hasn't had much success with household robots, but the iRobot acquisition and the company's strong market reputation provide a \"massive foothold in the consumer robot market\" that could help Amazon replicate the success of its Echo line of smart speakers, said Lian Jye Su, a robotics industry analyst for ABI Research. Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a \"race-to-the-bottom\" competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum. On Friday, iRobot reported its quarterly results. Revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions and delays, and the company announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce. Amazon said it will acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction that will include iRobot's net debt. The company has total current debt of approximately $332.1 million as of July 2.
