Amazon entered into a definitive merger agreement last month to acquire iRobot, maker of the popular Roomba vacuum cleaner. But privacy advocates worry that Amazon will use this product to vacuum up information about consumer homes and private lives. \"Allowing Amazon to absorb a competing smart home device business with access to incredibly detailed consumer data would endanger fair competition and open markets while also jeopardizing consumer privacy,\" according to the letter. The FTC is reportedly looking into Amazon's iRobot acquisition. Acquiring iRobot could provide Amazon with a significant amount of consumer data, said Gartner analyst Bill Ray. Roomba vacuums provide details such as room layouts, the number of rooms in a house and furniture placement. \"The size of your rooms, the thickness of your carpet -- that sort of information is very useful,\" Ray said. \"You can tell a lot about a person by that kind of thing.\" Amazon already knows a significant portion of its customers have more than one Alexa product, with the kitchen being the most popular location, Ray said.

The purchase of iRobot is Amazon's fourth-largest acquisition, led by its $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods in 2017. Last month, the company said it would buy the primary care provider One Medical in a deal valued roughly at $3.9 billion, a move that expanded its reach further into health care. On Friday, groups advocating for stricter antitrust regulations called on regulators to block the iRobot merger, arguing it gives Amazon more access into consumers' lives and furthers its dominance in the smart home market. \"The last thing American and the world needs is Amazon vacuuming up even more of our personal information,\" said Robert Weissman, president of the progressive consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen. \"This is not just about Amazon selling another device in its marketplace,\" Weissman said. \"It's about the company gaining still more intimate details of our lives to gain unfair market advantage and sell us more stuff.","Jaccard Noise_60":0.0,"Cosine Noise_60":0.1451398879,"EM Noise_60":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_60":0,"Noise_80 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_80 Document Index":"6","Noise_80 Document":"By  Jon Porter, a reporter with five years of experience covering consumer tech releases, EU tech policy, online platforms, and mechanical keyboards.
