This story contains spoilers from Criminal Minds: Evolution season 1. Criminal Minds: Evolution promised fans a jam-packed season full of twists and turns \u2014 and boy, did it deliver. Since the former CBS procedural drama got rebooted on Paramount+, viewers dove right back into the world of the BAU.  Over the course of 10 episodes, folks saw beloved FBI agents return, like Joe Mantegna's SSA David Rossi and Paget Brewster as unit chief Emily Prentiss. There were also moving family storylines, including one from A.J. Cook's SSA Jennifer Jareau. Aisha Tyler's Dr. Tara Lewis and Kirsten Vangsness's Penelope Garcia dealt with relationship problems, while Adam Rodriguez's SSA Luke Alvez acted as support for his fellow teammates. And all the while, the BAU followed through as they hunted down Sicarius, portrayed by season-long guest star Zach Gilford. But like its predecessor, Criminal Minds: Evolution isn't over yet. The show is set to return for season 2, promising more drama. What's more, the season finale left fans wondering what exactly will happen now that Sicarius may be involved in something more sinister.","Jaccard Noise_40":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_40":0.3522495031,"EM Noise_40":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_40":1,"Noise_60 Predicted Answer":"Criminal Minds: Evolution","Noise_60 Document Index":"1","Noise_60 Document":"By Denise Petski  Senior Managing Editor Paramount+\u2019s upcoming Criminal Minds revival now has an official title.

If a company like Shark --which also makes robot vacuums -- acquired iRobot, he believes that's a definitive competition concern. Amazon, however, isn't a market leader in vacuum robots, making it difficult to pinpoint the competition argument, he said. \"Obviously it makes iRobot a very serious competitor, and if I was making robot vacuum cleaners, I would be nervous,\" Ray said. \"But that's not enough to trigger a competition investigation.\" Ray said that subscription revenues are becoming increasingly important for companies needing long-term commitment and revenue, and Amazon could turn its iRobot acquisition into a subscription service. \"You could imagine paying for a Roomba on a subscription whereby spare parts are automatically sent to you, new brushes are automatically sent to you, and indeed the product itself would be cheap to make up for that,\" Ray said. \"So I think they see that as going towards a subscription service.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.1169644967,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_20 Document Index":"3","Noise_20 Document":"Quotes displayed in real-time or delayed by at least 15 minutes.

Amazon is drawing criticism for its plan to acquire Roomba maker iRobot for $1.7 billion in an effort to expand its footprint in the home devices and consumer robotics markets. Ron Knox, a senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self Reliance, has called on regulators to challenge the deal, calling it the \"most dangerous, threatening\" acquisition in the e-commerce behemoth's history. In a lengthy Twitter thread on Aug. 5, Knox argued that the deal would take Amazon's biggest rival out of the market and allow it to beat the remaining competition through predatory pricing. \"Jeff Bezos has said that Amazon wants to buy its way to dominance. By snatching up Roomba and pairing it with its vast monopoly power fueled by its Prime system, it would do just that,\" he said. \"There may be other smart vacuums today, but there won't be once Amazon owns Roomba.","Jaccard Noise_20":1.0,"Cosine Noise_20":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_20":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_20":1,"Noise_40 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_40 Document Index":"1","Noise_40 Document":"By\u00a0        The Associated Press                          An iRobot Terra lawn mower is shown in Bedford, Mass., on Jan. 16, 2019.
