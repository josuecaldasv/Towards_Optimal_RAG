{"Query":"What is the title of the new season of \"Criminal Minds\"?","Correct Answer":["Evolution"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Criminal Minds: Evolution","Noise_0 Document Index":"5","Noise_0 Document":"The Criminal Minds reboot on Paramount+ gets a brand new title which effectively resolves one of the biggest problems of the upcoming series.  The Criminal Minds reboot's new title - Criminal Minds: Evolution - resolves one of its biggest problems. Paramount+ is bringing back FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) to the small screen not long after the team wrapped up its run on CBS for 15 years. While the profilers will miss a couple of their co-workers such as Matthew Gray Gubler's Spencer Reid and Daniel Henney's Matt Simmons, the rest of the squad will be intact as they track down a network of UnSubs which was established during the coronavirus pandemic. Many aspects of the original Criminal Minds run will stay the same, but Evolutions has some fresh aspects, including a new title. Retitling Paramount+'s Criminal Minds revival as Criminal Minds: Evolution is appropriate given this new version of the show. The project is a continuation of its CBS run, so technically, it isn't really a \"reboot\" as it has usually been referred to. The cast remains the same and its events take place in the same continuity. Instead of calling it Criminal Minds season 16, however, giving it a different title allows it to separate itself from the CBS procedural without totally severing its ties with it. It also hints that everything in Criminal Minds: Evolution is an evolved version of the original show, which seems to be the case.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.3333333333,"Cosine Noise_0":0.3522495031,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Criminal Minds: Evolution","Noise_20 Document Index":"1","Noise_20 Document":"Join or Sign In Sign in to customize your TV listings By joining TV Guide, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy.

It has been a while since the profilers' last on-screen case, but the characters' stories continued during that period. Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn\u2019t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series. Having its official title of Criminal Minds: Evolution quickly establishes that the show is part of the Criminal Minds brand, which could entice some formers fans to check it out, especially those who haven\u2019t been keeping track of Paramount+\u2019s efforts to bring back the BAU on the small screen.
