{"Query":"What company acquired iRobot?","Correct Answer":["Amazon"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_0 Document Index":"5","Noise_0 Document":"LuckyStep - stock.adobe.com More than 20 civil rights and data privacy organizations sent a letter Friday to the Federal Trade Commission asking the agency to challenge Amazon's acquisition of iRobot, calling it a privacy and competition threat. Amazon entered into a definitive merger agreement last month to acquire iRobot, maker of the popular Roomba vacuum cleaner. But privacy advocates worry that Amazon will use this product to vacuum up information about consumer homes and private lives. \"Allowing Amazon to absorb a competing smart home device business with access to incredibly detailed consumer data would endanger fair competition and open markets while also jeopardizing consumer privacy,\" according to the letter. The FTC is reportedly looking into Amazon's iRobot acquisition. Acquiring iRobot could provide Amazon with a significant amount of consumer data, said Gartner analyst Bill Ray. Roomba vacuums provide details such as room layouts, the number of rooms in a house and furniture placement. \"The size of your rooms, the thickness of your carpet -- that sort of information is very useful,\" Ray said. \"You can tell a lot about a person by that kind of thing.\" Amazon already knows a significant portion of its customers have more than one Alexa product, with the kitchen being the most popular location, Ray said. With the acquisition of iRobot, its vacuum products could be used to glean information about a consumer home, including which rooms include Alexa products, he said.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"By  Jon Porter, a reporter with five years of experience covering consumer tech releases, EU tech policy, online platforms, and mechanical keyboards.

In a press release, the European Commission said it\u2019s concerned that \u201cthe transaction would allow Amazon to restrict competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners (\u2018RVCs\u2019) and to strengthen its position as online marketplace provider.\u201d The European Commission is also looking at how getting access to iRobot users\u2019 data may give Amazon an advantage \u201cin the market for online marketplace services to third-party sellers (and related advertising services) and \/ or other data-related markets.\u201d  \u201cWe continue to work through the process with the European Commission and are focused on addressing its questions and any identified concerns at this stage,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Alexandra Miller said in a statement. \u201ciRobot, which faces intense competition from other vacuum cleaner suppliers, offers practical and inventive products.

Amazon\u2019s acquisition of iRobot has already been given the green light by one significant competition regulator, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA concluded that the deal will not lead to competition concerns in the UK, given iRobot has \u201cseveral significant rivals\u201d in the space and that \u201cthe UK market for robot vacuum cleaners is small (and not expected to grow significantly in the future).\u201d Getting the CMA\u2019s approval is significant, given the regulator has previously opposed Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and forced Meta to unwind its Giphy acquisition.
