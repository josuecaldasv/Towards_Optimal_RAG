While there are clear data privacy concerns stemming from the Amazon iRobot acquisition, proving an anticompetitive argument could be trickier, Ray said. If a company like Shark --which also makes robot vacuums -- acquired iRobot, he believes that's a definitive competition concern. Amazon, however, isn't a market leader in vacuum robots, making it difficult to pinpoint the competition argument, he said. \"Obviously it makes iRobot a very serious competitor, and if I was making robot vacuum cleaners, I would be nervous,\" Ray said. \"But that's not enough to trigger a competition investigation.\" Ray said that subscription revenues are becoming increasingly important for companies needing long-term commitment and revenue, and Amazon could turn its iRobot acquisition into a subscription service. \"You could imagine paying for a Roomba on a subscription whereby spare parts are automatically sent to you, new brushes are automatically sent to you, and indeed the product itself would be cheap to make up for that,\" Ray said. \"So I think they see that as going towards a subscription service.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.1169644967,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_20 Document Index":"5","Noise_20 Document":"Sep 9, 2022 ...
