I am really upset it will be on Paramount plus as I can\u2019t afford more money on our cable bill., as my husband and I are retired.   This was m y favorite show.  Many others are in our situation.

{"Query":"What company acquired iRobot?","Correct Answer":["Amazon"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_0 Document Index":"5","Noise_0 Document":"\"Amazon's success relied on selling low price Ring doorbells through its almost ubiquitous e-commerce platform, aided by integration with the company's subscription program, Amazon Prime.\" Amazon's iRobot acquisition could follow a similar pattern, the privacy groups said. While there are clear data privacy concerns stemming from the Amazon iRobot acquisition, proving an anticompetitive argument could be trickier, Ray said. If a company like Shark --which also makes robot vacuums -- acquired iRobot, he believes that's a definitive competition concern. Amazon, however, isn't a market leader in vacuum robots, making it difficult to pinpoint the competition argument, he said. \"Obviously it makes iRobot a very serious competitor, and if I was making robot vacuum cleaners, I would be nervous,\" Ray said. \"But that's not enough to trigger a competition investigation.\" Ray said that subscription revenues are becoming increasingly important for companies needing long-term commitment and revenue, and Amazon could turn its iRobot acquisition into a subscription service. \"You could imagine paying for a Roomba on a subscription whereby spare parts are automatically sent to you, new brushes are automatically sent to you, and indeed the product itself would be cheap to make up for that,\" Ray said. \"So I think they see that as going towards a subscription service.","Jaccard Noise_0":1.0,"Cosine Noise_0":1.0000001192,"EM Noise_0":1.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":1,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Amazon","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"A slew of home-cleaning robots adds to the company's tech arsenal, making it more involved in consumer's lives beyond static things like voice control. Amazon's Astro robot, which helps with tasks like setting an alarm, was unveiled last year at an introductory price of $1,000. But its rollout has been limited and has received a lackluster response. The company hasn't had much success with household robots, but the iRobot acquisition and the company's strong market reputation provide a \"massive foothold in the consumer robot market\" that could help Amazon replicate the success of its Echo line of smart speakers, said Lian Jye Su, a robotics industry analyst for ABI Research. Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a \"race-to-the-bottom\" competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum. On Friday, iRobot reported its quarterly results. Revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions and delays, and the company announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce. Amazon said it will acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction that will include iRobot's net debt. The company has total current debt of approximately $332.1 million as of July 2. The deal is subject to approval by shareholders and regulators.
