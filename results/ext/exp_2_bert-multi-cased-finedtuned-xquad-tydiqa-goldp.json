{"Query":"What is the title of the new season of \"Criminal Minds\"?","Correct Answer":["Evolution"],"Noise_0 Predicted Answer":"Criminal Minds","Noise_0 Document Index":"5","Noise_0 Document":"The Criminal Minds reboot on Paramount+ gets a brand new title which effectively resolves one of the biggest problems of the upcoming series.  The Criminal Minds reboot's new title - Criminal Minds: Evolution - resolves one of its biggest problems. Paramount+ is bringing back FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) to the small screen not long after the team wrapped up its run on CBS for 15 years. While the profilers will miss a couple of their co-workers such as Matthew Gray Gubler's Spencer Reid and Daniel Henney's Matt Simmons, the rest of the squad will be intact as they track down a network of UnSubs which was established during the coronavirus pandemic. Many aspects of the original Criminal Minds run will stay the same, but Evolutions has some fresh aspects, including a new title. Retitling Paramount+'s Criminal Minds revival as Criminal Minds: Evolution is appropriate given this new version of the show. The project is a continuation of its CBS run, so technically, it isn't really a \"reboot\" as it has usually been referred to. The cast remains the same and its events take place in the same continuity. Instead of calling it Criminal Minds season 16, however, giving it a different title allows it to separate itself from the CBS procedural without totally severing its ties with it. It also hints that everything in Criminal Minds: Evolution is an evolved version of the original show, which seems to be the case.","Jaccard Noise_0":0.0,"Cosine Noise_0":0.1737959087,"EM Noise_0":0.0,"EM - 2V Noise_0":0,"Noise_20 Predicted Answer":"Criminal Minds: Evolution","Noise_20 Document Index":"6","Noise_20 Document":"By   \tSelome Hailu   \tThe Paramount+ revival of \u201cCriminal Minds\u201d has set a new title: \u201cCriminal Minds: Evolution.\u201d Additionally, Zach Gilford has been added to the cast as a recurring guest star.  \t\u201cCriminal Minds: Evolution\u201d will premiere this fall, expanding upon the long-running series that originally concluded in 2020 after 15 seasons.
